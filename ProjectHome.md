## **Overview:** ##
**Android Bird's Eye** is a modified open-source engine using the **Replica Island Source Code** by _Chris Pruett_ and modified by _TwoD Vision_ for **Android compatible phones**. This was meant to be the starting point for a new project by _TwoD Vision_, but never generated enough interest.

## **Features:** ##
  * A Tiled based Map editing system
  * Level-Tree based level select
  * Physics based player movement (rather than tiled)
  * Enemies with movement systems and contact damage
  * Collision based barrier system
  * On-Screen touch controls

## **Downloading:** ##
To quickly download the files, the src files are all located in **feralvillage.zip** and the res files are located in **res.zip** on the _**Source**_ tab.

## **DevNotes:** ##
I am releasing this work in progress as open source since, in the past few months, I have lost a great amount of interest in developing games. If you would like help learning the engine, advice on how to use it, etc. I will be happy to help as I can. I will try to create some tutorials in the next few weeks to help you better use the engine.
